What new knowledge or skills did you take away from this project? If you learned a new language for this assignment, make sure to tell us.

I had heard about Go but never had the chance to try it out before, so I took this opportunity to do the Systems Assignment using Go. I found that although the syntax took some getting used to, it was a relatively pain-free learning experience. I'd definitely use Go for more projects in the future. Moreover, for the General Assignment, I decided to use Next.js instead of normal React, as I had heard it offered more ease-of-use features out-of-the-box than React. I found it very helpful that I didn't need to build my own router, and the CSS optimizations were helpful in condensing the size of the final project.


What was the most difficult part of this assignment?

The most difficult part of the assignment was definitely the combination of JWT and Go, as it was my first time coming into contact with both technologies. The assignment was a fun experience overall, even considering the numerous challenges along the way, and look forward to further my knowledge in these areas.
